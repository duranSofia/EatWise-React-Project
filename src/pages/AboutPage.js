          <p>
            At EatWise we care about transparency and better education on what
            we put in our table. Our goal is to serve all kinds of people, those
            have dietary restrictions can benefit the most with our filtered
            search and clear indicators of unsafe allergens. We want to make the
            long and complicated lists of product ingredients transparent and
            comprehendible, enabling people to shop better and live better.
            EatWise is a tool you can use while shopping or even to plan ahead
            from the comfort of your home.
