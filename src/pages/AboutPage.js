            At EatWise weâ€™re building a world where people can easily find
            products that benefit their health and nurture the future of our
            planet. We make the long and complicated lists of product
            ingredients transparent and comprehendible, enabling people to shop
            better and live better. EatWise is a personal and easy-to-use
            shopping assistant for healthy and sustainable consumption. Through
            scanning the barcode of foods or cosmetics, the app displays a
            rating and product recommendations based on the latest scientific
            research and individual settings.
